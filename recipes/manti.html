    <img src="../images/Manti.webp" alt="Image of a Manti dish" width="300px" height="500px">
    <p><em>Manti is a type of dumpling popular in most cuisines of the Central Asia, West Asia, South Caucasus, Balkans, and Afghanistan.</em></p> 
    <p><em>The dumplings typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef, wrapped in a thin dough sheet which is then boiled or steamed. The size and shape of manti vary significantly depending on geographic location.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingridiends:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour,</li>
        <li>1 egg,</li>
        <li>1 cup of water,</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt,</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil,</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef,</li>
        <li>1 large potato, peeled and diced into a pea sized cubes,</li>
        <li>1/2 medium butternut squash or pumpkin, peeled and diced into a pea sized cubes,</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, finely diced,</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, softened,</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin,</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste,</li>
        <li>few bay leaves and peppercorns,</li>
        <li>fresh herbs like parsley, dill, chives and cilantro to garnish, chopped (optional),</li>
        <li>sour cream to garnish (optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl whisk the egg with salt and sugar. Then add the water and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil and mix everything until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Kneed the dough until a smooth dough ball forms. Cover, and set aside, letting the dough rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting prepare the filling by combining beef, potato, squash and onions.</li>
        <li>Add the softened butter, cumin, salt, pepper and mix everything thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 4 parts and roll out one piece at a time into a thin sheet.</li>
        <li>Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, form a rectangle and cut it into 9 equal squares.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the filling onto each square and fasten the ends cross-wise, like an envelope. Then seal the dough all the way through to secure the filling inside. Refer to the picture guide.</li>
        <li>Repeat to use up all the dough and steam the manti for 20-30 minutes over the water with bay leaves and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Serve garnished with chopped herbs and sour cream.</li>
